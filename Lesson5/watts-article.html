            <h1>Trust</h1>
            <h2>Alan Watts</h2>
            <p>
                It’s very funny to come to California—you know, when you’ve lived elsewhere 
                and it’s been an ideal—and suddenly you wake up and you realize you’re there! 
                You know? You’re on vacation, you’ve got there, and everybody else envies you. 
                And so we have to learn how to be there—or rather, to be here. Of course, it is 
                always possible to construe the thing in another way and to say, “Yes, it may 
                be a game, but it’s a ghastly game; it’s a grim game.” It’s like a child who’s 
                caught a fly alive and is picking the wings off it. The universe is that sort 
                of scheme. It’s a trap. It’s a thing that gives you hope, is always dangling 
                possibilities in front of you to keep you going, but then it grinds you up. And 
                then it revives you a little, like a master torturer keeping a person alive in 
                order to experience pain. There is a kind of inverted mystical experience that 
                people occasionally have where they see the whole universe as this sort of trap, 
                and everything looks crummy. People look as if they’re made of plastic, and aren’t 
                really people but only make-believe people. They’re mechanisms which are going 
                “Yakety yak” and pretending that they are really there and alive. And everything 
                looks as if it were made of patent leather or enameled tin, and just a nasty, 
                dead scene. That’s the inverted mystical experience. And one might ask, “Well, you 
                could take that view, too.” And here you come to what Albert Camus said: “The 
                fundamentally important philosophical question is whether or not to commit suicide.”
            </p>
            <p>Now, this is the real question: Is the game worth the candle? If you think “No,” then 
                you’d better commit suicide. That’s the logical thing to do. If—on the other hand—you’re 
                not sure, then you’d better make up your mind. Because if you’re going to go on with 
                the game of life and not be sure as to whether it’s really worth going on, you’ll make 
                a mess of it. That’s quite certain. It’s like doing something evil, like telling a lie.
                If you’re going to tell a lie at all, you have to make it stick, and so, make it good. 
                Don’t wobble when you lie, because someone will find you out and it’ll all fall apart, 
                and it’ll be worse than if you never did it. So if you make up your mind that you’re going 
                to do something evil, you have to have—like a golf swing—follow-through. And so, in the 
                same way, with going on living at all: if you’re going to gamble, gamble! And so, either 
                suicide or gamble seem to me to be the great alternatives of this life.
            </p>


            <p>And what will the gamble be? The gamble—or the gaming—has to rest on the assumption that this game is 
                superb. No other assumption will work. If I may put it in another way: the game is to be trusted. 
                The universe—you, yourself—it is fundamentally to be trusted, and this is the act of faith which 
                underlies all gambling. Because if you don’t make that assumption as absolutely basic, the game will 
                not work. Now, this is where one must consider game theory in relation to ethics. What are the 
                characteristics of a workable game? A viable game, as biologists would call it; a game that is worth 
                the candle?
            </p>

            <p>First of all, the game must involve an optimal combination of skill and chance. Or, we might say order
                and randomness. Where a game is pure chance, it loses interest. Let’s just think of tossing coins: the 
                chances are 50-50, always, that it will be either heads or tails. And this becomes very boring. One 
                wants to cheat a little to liven it up, and so introduce a bit of skill. But where a game depends on 
                pure skill, and especially a very complex kind of skill, it becomes too tiresome. So you could put at 
                opposite ends of a spectrum of games, say, tossing coins or tic-tac-toe—or something very simple which 
                is mostly chance (because tic-tac-toe, when you know how to play it, reduces itself to that you either 
                win or draw if you get the first move)—at the other end of the scale, a highly complex game like… well,
                I’ve suggested three-dimensional chess, but just imagine three-dimensional go, where you would play on 
                eight boards to give yourself a cube to play in, or whatever number of boards—go would be more than that, 
                wouldn’t it? But you would be in such a complex thing that you’d just lose track of it. Eventually, the 
                game would just become totally confused for most people. So we get optimal games in the middle—like bridge, 
                or poker, or checkers, or chess—where there is this interplay of skill and chance. So we look for this 
                optimal point where there is a risk—there must be a risk, there must be chance, it mustn’t all be 
                predetermined—because any game where the result is known is not worth playing. That’s to say, when, in 
                chess, the players suddenly realize that white is going to mate in five moves, they abandon the game and 
                say, “Let’s begin again.” And so in life. That’s why a lot of people don’t like going to fortune tellers. 
                They don’t want to know the future. If I know exactly what’s going to happen to me, in a very real sense 
                I’ve had it. So let’s finish it up and begin again; turn in the check. You see, the whole fun of the situation 
                of a game is that you don’t know the outcome, and that’s why it’s worth playing. This is one characteristic 
                of a viable game: a certain combination of skill and chance.
        </p>

            <p>Now, there’s another, which is of a much more ethical type, and that is—I will call it—trusting the game. 
                Because if you don’t do this—in other words, if you won’t gamble—you won’t play. And here is the point 
                of the necessity of the gamble that corresponds a little bit to the necessity of having chance as well as 
                skill in any game that really works. But the necessity of gambling is very much overlooked, I think, in our 
                contemporary culture because this is a culture where we are trying, as much as possible, to take the risk 
                out of things. And when the risk is taken out of human relationships they become impossible. We have, I think—in 
                the United States—a very naïve faith in law and in law enforcement. We’re always saying, “There ought to be a 
                law against it,” as if law could solve things. And we don’t realize the extent to which law makes life increasingly
                 more difficult. Because law is simply a process of trying to define what may be done and what may not be done. 
                 But the moment you start talking, the definitions become increasingly complicated. And lawyers love this; 
                 they live on it. So, it’s always an interminable discussion of “What did they mean when they said that? What 
                 was the intent of this law?” And as laws multiply with the avowed object of protecting us from each other, 
                 they do not so much succeed in protecting us as they do in making it impossible for us to act. And so, the 
                 ultimate police state is, of course, the safe state: the security state where everybody is checked. And you 
                 see what this is? Mechanically speaking, it’s a system of very elaborate self-consciousness.
            </p>

            <p>See, when you get self-conscious and you watch everything you do because you’re anxious about making a mistake, 
                you find: in that you’re all tied up and you can’t act. So, in exactly the same way, a community of people which 
                is always watching itself through its agents, so that—you know, in a Nazi state there are not only the ordinary 
                policemen on the beat, but there’s a block captain for every area, and there’s some kind of a sneak or traitor 
                who’s going to inform the authorities… everywhere, you see; hidden—so this community is watching itself all the 
                time because it’s a community that doesn’t trust itself. And a community which constantly watches itself is like 
                a person who’s always watching himself and holding a club over his head to go CLUNK the minute he might be in 
                danger of doing something wrong. And so this person is like this: If I say, “Now, my right hand is my main active 
                hand, but I don’t know whether I can trust it. I don’t know what it’s going to do. So I’ve got to keep control 
                on it with my left hand.” See? So, always, the left hand is controlling the right hand. Whatever—if I want to pick 
                something up, the left hand will have to push the right hand down, and squeeze the fingers together, and then lift 
                it up so that it’ll come up. See? I’ve lost a hand by doing that. And so, in exactly the same way, when any community 
                of people is founded on mutual mistrust, it sort of loses half of itself, it becomes clutched up, it becomes paralyzed 
                and unable to move.
            </p>

            <p>So, the basis of any community—and thus the basis of any game—is the act of faith that I will gamble; I will bet my 
                life on this scene. And, you see, that also is fundamentally not only the attitude of faith, but it’s the attitude 
                of love. Love is self-giving. When you love someone—say, you fall in love with a member of your opposite sex, or 
                whatever—and you got mixed up with someone now. You’ve really committed yourself to heaven only knows what! Because 
                love is a letting go of direct control. And you might say—going back again to the Christian images of God—that God 
                creates the world by constantly disappearing, giving himself away. This—the Hindu would agree with this, too: that 
                insofar as everyone here is God in disguise, but doesn’t know it—this is because you, as God, are constantly giving 
                yourself away to you and feeling lost. You know? How did I get mixed up in this world? Well, unbeknownst to myself I 
                made a gamble on being this person. And so this giving of one’s self away is what’s called the divine love.
            </p>

            <p>So then, in playing the game, if you don’t make the assumption that I can let go of myself in the act of faith and 
                in the act of love, you may just as well commit suicide right now—because you can’t play it on any other basis than 
                that. Any attempt to do so will merely make the whole thing clutch up and become insupportable, and will—in any 
                case—be suicide. See, when we get the ultimate weapon with which we know we can be safe because nobody else has it, 
                just because we wanted to get that ultimate safety and get that ultimate weapon to defeat our enemies, it will be 
                suicide. Because life really is not the avoidance of death. Death is the avoidance of death. The constant terror of 
                death, the constant putting it off, the constant vigilance that one will not die—that is death! What we call life is, 
                fundamentally, willingness to die. Constant jumping of being into not-being. So long as you do that, it goes on. So: 
                so long as you shake the dice and you don’t know how they’re going to come out and flip, the game goes on, you see? 
                So long as you take a chance.
